            <h3>Travel recommend</h3>
            <p>I had started my first step to travel since I was 10 years old. The first country I went to is Korea. I don't remember clearly but I remember that is a happiness meoery in my childhood. when I was growing up, I have been to Japan, Malaysia, Singarpore, Vietnam，Thailand, Dubai, New      zeland, Canada and U.S. Most of coutries I visited with my family. Last year, in spring break, I went to Cancun, Mexico, with my friends. Cancun is so brilian to be visited in spring or summmer. In United States, I also have many awesome travel experience. Foa instances, I took a        helicopter in Las vegas, dived in Key west, took ship below the Niagara Falls. 
               I love travel because I will learn a lot from the process. When you face some emergency situation, you will learn how to calm down and figure out it; you will learn how to arrange your schedule; you will learn how to communi- cate with the stranger; you may make some friends on the way. Moraover, you will know some in- tersting culture of other countries and watch some amazing land- scapes.So, take your bags and go to the trip!
               “For my part, I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel’s sake. The great affair is to move.” – Robert Louis Steven- son. I want to tell everyone, take your bags and go to the trip, you will find a brand new world! Love travel, Love your life!
