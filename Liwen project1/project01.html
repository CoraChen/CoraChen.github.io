            <h3>Hobby</h3>
            <p class="hobby">I love music. I love singsing when I have time. In China, my dad runs a karaoke company,so I always
               go to there to practise singing. I always hang out with friends in Karaoke. Moreover, I love cook, too. Actually many of my my friends cook not very well or some of them hate to do it, but I think cook is interesting. I love to eat many delicious food so I want to create them by myself. but I'm just good at Asian foods, and still exploring in Western foods. My favorite habby is travel. I have been to 11 countries and most of provinces in China. I also have been to. After I came to United States, I also love to travel around the Ameirca. I have visited more than 10 cities in U.S, such as NYC, LA, San francisico, and Chicago. I love every places that I have been to, because I think every cities or countries have their own charm. </p>

            <h3>Travel experience</h3>
            <p class="travel">I had started my first step to travel since I was 10 years old. The first country I went to is Korea. I don't remember clearly but I remember that is a happiness meoery in my childhood. when I was growing up, I have been to Japan, Malaysia, Singarpore, Vietnam，Thailand, Dubai, New zeland, Canada and U.S. Most of coutries I visited with my family. Last year, in spring break, I went to Cancun, Mexico, with my friends. Cancun is so brilian to be visited in spring or summmer. In United States, I also have many awesome travel experience. For instances, I took a helicopter in Las vegas, dived in Key west, took ship below the Niagara Falls. 
            I love travel because I will learn a lot from the process. When I faced some emergency situation, I learned how to calm down and figure out it; I learned how to arrange your schedule; I learned how to communicate with the stranger; I made some friends on the way. Moreover, I knew some interesting culture from other countries and watched some amazing landscapes. “For my part, I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel’s sake. The great affair is to move.” – Robert Louis Steven- son. I want to tell everyone, take your bags and go to the trip, you will find a brand new world! Love travel, Love your life!
